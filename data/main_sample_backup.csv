Coal-fired power plants have been a major source of electricity for the city and the surrounding regions. However, Delhi has been grappling with serious air quality and environmental issues, including high levels of air pollution and smog.

As a result, there has been a growing awareness of the negative environmental and health impacts associated with coal-based power generation. In response to these challenges, there have been efforts to reduce the reliance on coal and transition to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, such as natural gas, renewables, and improved energy efficiency.

Government policies and initiatives have also been implemented to promote cleaner energy alternatives and reduce the emissions from coal-based power plants. These efforts aim to improve air quality and reduce the health risks associated with coal-related pollution.

If you have specific survey results or more recent information about the role of the coal industry in Delhi, I would be happy to provide more tailored insights based on that data.
