However, to produce energy or electricity from burning coal it also produces a high amount of carbon diaoxide which disbalances our atmosphere if it is produce at high rate at the same time energy is produce by coal burning and if we want to eliminate coal burning for energy purposes first we need to secure our other energy sources like renewable energy. If we successfully secured our energy requirements from other sources of energy specially from renewable energy then we would see a decline in coal burning thus, decline in carbon emissions.",I love  this survey 😍.
